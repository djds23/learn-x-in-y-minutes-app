# Learn X in Y Minutes App

[Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com) is a great site created by [@adambard](https://github.com/adambard) and hosts hundreds of short programming language tutorials written by himself and many other contributors on [GitHub](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs) for professional programmers to get up to speed quickly on a new language.

I needed to have access to those great tutorials for some of my favorite programming languages on my phone for offline viewing. So I created this Progressive Web App using Ionic 2 framework. You can also build and install this app on your device as any other mobile apps.
